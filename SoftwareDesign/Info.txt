This directory contains the enhancements for my CS 499 Capstone Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering.

My initial artifact was a single file (wStation.py) that displayed temperature and humidity data to the console and to the LCD screen module. This information was collected via Grovepi sensor modules. Certain temperature and humidity conditions would illuminate either a red, blue, green or combination of LEDs to reflect those conditions. 

With this Milestone I removed the LED lights and applied their function to the LCD screen. The LEDs were used to indicate different temperature ranges and were limited to red, green, and blue. The LCD color function was used instead and allows for more variation to be color coded. The if-else loop did not have a condition for 60 degree or below, so this was added for loop completion. The comments were modified to be more standardized, frequent, and transparent. I added another module, a light sensor, to allow the weather station to indicate day or night conditions. To verify each module is functioning as intended, I created a Python script to test the LCD screen, DHT and light sensor. Rather than the weather station and module tests are all accessed from a menu script which creates an ease of use for the end user. To make this a one click operation, I created an executable script, allowing the user to click the script (FILENAME: weatherStation), which will run the menu.py program, opening a terminal window presenting a menu for the user to interact with. Finally, I ensure all displays (console and LCD screen) are correctly formatted with appropriate new line characters, and cleared all displays with reset messages upon stop, quit or error. The zip file contains all the Python scripts and executable script. It is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi with Grovepi and modules.

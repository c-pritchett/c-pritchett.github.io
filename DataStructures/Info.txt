This directory contains the enhancements for my CS 499 Capstone Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures.

This Milestone I implemented further functionality into my weather station, utilizing data structures with Python to store and organize the environmental 
data collected from the sensors. I first created two Python dictionaries, one for day and one for night values, to store temperature and humidity values. 
These data structures are initialized outside the While True loop in the main weather station python script. To give these values meaning, a variable for 
a timestamp is initialized, formatted, and dumped to json compatible formatting. This timestamp is initialized and assigned to every loop iteration, giving 
the temperature and humidity values a date and time of their logging. Further down in the main weather station script is an if else loop with conditions for 
the light sensor. Previously this would either display data to the console or display a message that it is too dark. The if else loop now will store a 
timestamp, temperature, and humidity data to the daylight data structure, writing it and appending it to a day light json file if light conditions are bright. 
If it is too dark, t the if else loop now will store a timestamp, temperature, and humidity data to the nighttime data structure, writing and appending it to 
the nighttime json file. This gives us two separate json files to work with and display, as well as exact times.

***The two JSON files are sample data, not intended to represent factual day/night times***

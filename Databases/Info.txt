This directory contains the enhancements for my CS 499 Capstone Enhancement Three: Databases.

This artifact enhancement took the results of my efforts last week (the JSON files) and used them in a meaningful way. The JSON files were created via Python 
script, and then utilized in JavaScript within an HTML file. This allows the end user to display the weather data collected for day and night in their standard 
web browser. This enhancement showcased my ability to use multiple languages and work with a database to utilize them for the user. Additionally, it also show 
cases my ability to translate information gathered in one language and convert it to a readable format for the other language. This directory contains the same
Python files from earlier weeks, the same JSON files but with new sample data and the addition of a new HTML file. The HTML file is the user display and is can
be viewed from the main Github userpages view.

***The two JSON files are sample data, not intended to represent factual day/night times***
